  title = {Parse Forest Diagnostics with Dr. Ambiguity},
  author = {Bas Basten and Jurgen Vinju},
  booktitle = {International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE)},
  year = 2011,
  publisher = {Springer},
  series = {LNCS},
}
```

Which automated the manual instructions found here:

The ambiguity detection algorithm -via random tree generation- is a port in Rascal of the method published
by our colleagues in this paper:

  editor = {Erwig, Martin and Paige, Richard F. and Van Wyk, Eric},
  pages = {157--176},
  publisher = {Springer International Publishing},
  title = {Detecting Ambiguity in Programming Language Grammars},
